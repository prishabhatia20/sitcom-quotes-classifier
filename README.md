# sitcom-quotes-classifier

Welcome to our Sitcom Quotes Classifier! For this project, we were interested in creating a model that can receive
quotes from popular sitcoms and guess which character said that quote. We chose three sitcoms we like: The Office,
Friends, and Brooklyn 99. In order to make this a little more interesting, we decided to make a game where users
can play against the model to see whether they can beat the model! In order to get started, follow the directions
in the installs section, and then run `main.py` to play against the model.

## An Important Question . . . 
Can you beat the model?
